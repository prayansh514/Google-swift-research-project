/**
 * \ingroup congestionOps
 *
 * \brief An implementation of TCP Swift
 *
 * TCP Swift is a pure delay-based congestion control algorithm implementing a proactive
 * scheme that tries to prevent packet drops by maintaining a small backlog at the
 * bottleneck queue.
 *
 * Swift continuously measures the actual throughput a connection achieves as shown in
 * Equation (1) and compares it with the expected throughput calculated in Equation (2).
 * The difference between these 2 sending rates in Equation (3) reflects the amount of
 * extra packets being queued at the bottleneck.
 *
 *              actual = cwnd / RTT        (1)
 *              expected = cwnd / BaseRTT  (2)
 *              diff = expected - actual   (3)
 *
 * To avoid congestion, Swift linearly increases/decreases its congestion window to ensure
 * the diff value fall between the 2 predefined thresholds, alpha and beta.
 * diff and another threshold, gamma, are used to determine when Swift should change from
 * its slow-start mode to linear increase/decrease mode.
 *
 * Following the implementation of Swift in Linux, we use 2, 4, and 1 as the default values
 * of alpha, beta, and gamma, respectively.
 *
